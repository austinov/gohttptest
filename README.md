### GoHttpTest - Simplified golang HTTP server

This is a simplified golang HTTP server which listens a custom host and port (not on a system-chosen port as in net/http/httptest) for using it in HTTP tests.

Example of usage can be found in server_test.go

### To run test:

    cd path/to/gohttptest
    go test
